Initialize React Project:

- Set up the project structure with components, pages, and Redux store.
- Install necessary dependencies: react-router-dom, redux, react-redux, axios, json-server, bcryptjs for password hashing.

Set Up JSON Server:

- Create a db.json file to store user and shopping list data.
- Configure json-server to run alongside the React app.

Authentication and User Management:

- Registration
- - UI Components

- - - Form with fields for name, surname, email, username, password, and profile picture input.
- - - Submit button.
- - - Link to login page.

- Process:

- - User fills out the registration form.
- - When the user submits the form:
- - - HandleProfilePictureChange:
- - - - Set the profile picture to the selected file.

- - HandleRegister:
- - - Prevent the default form submission.

- - - Hash the password.

- - Create a user object with the hashed password and profile picture.
- - - Send the user object to the API.

- - Show an alert indicating successful registration.
- - - If an error occurs, log the error and show an alert indicating failure.

Login

- UI Components:

- - Form with fields for email and password.
- - Submit button.
- - Link to registration page.

- Process:

- - User enters email and password.
- - When the user submits the form:

- - - HandleLogin:
- - - - Prevent the default form submission.
- - - - Fetch all users from the API.
- - - - Find the user by email.
- - - - If the user exists and the password matches:
- - - - Save user details to localStorage.
- - - - Navigate to the home page.
- - - - If credentials are invalid, show an alert.
- - - - If an error occurs, log the error and show an alert.

Profile Management

- UI Components:

- - Display user profile information and profile picture.
- - Form to update profile information.
- - Submit button.

- Process:

- - User views their profile.
- - User updates profile information:

- - - HandleProfilePictureChange:
- - - - Set the profile picture to the selected file.

- - - HandleSaveProfile:
- - - - Prevent the default form submission.
- - - - Create a form data object with user details and profile picture.
- - - - Update the user profile using the API.
- - - - Show a success alert.
- - - - If an error occurs, log the error and show an error alert.

Shopping List Management:

- CRUD Operations:
- - Create:
- - - Implement a form to add a new shopping list (name, quantity, notes, category, image).
- - Read:
- - - Display all shopping lists added by the user.
- - Update:
- - - Implement functionality to edit existing shopping lists.
- - Delete:
- - - Allow users to delete shopping lists and individual items.

- Search and Filter:
- - Implement a search bar to search items by name, updating the URL with the search keyword.
- - Implement sorting functionality based on name, category, and date added, updating the URL.

State Management with Redux:

- Setup Redux Store:
- - Create slices for user authentication and shopping lists.
- - Manage application state using Redux for consistent data handling across components.

- Integrate Redux with Components:
- - Use useSelector to access state and useDispatch to handle actions.

- Persist Data:
- - Ensure data persistence using localStorage for user session management.

UI/UX Design:

- Responsive Design:
- - Ensure the app is responsive across different screen sizes.
- - Implement a consistent layout and theme across all pages.

- Navigation:
- - Set up navigation between Login, Registration, Home, and Profile pages using react-router-dom.
- - Use protected routes to restrict access based on authentication state.

- Interactive Elements:
- - Provide visual feedback on hover for clickable elements.
- - Use modals, alerts, or notifications for user actions like adding, editing, or deleting items.

- Performance and Security:

- - Optimize App Performance:
- - Optimize Redux actions and reducers to ensure smooth performance.
- - Use lazy loading for components to improve load times.

- Implement Security Measures:
- - Encrypt sensitive data like user credentials.
- - Use protected routes to safeguard user data and prevent unauthorized access.
